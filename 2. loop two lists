There will be two arrays of integers. Determine all integers that satisfy the following two conditions:

The elements of the first array are all factors of the integer being considered
The integer being considered is a factor of all elements of the second array
These numbers are referred to as being between the two arrays. Determine how many such numbers exist.
2. loop two lists using one 'for i in ...''

def getTotalX(a, b):
    list1 = []
    for i in range(a[-1],b[0]+1):
        if all([i % j == 0 for j in a]):
            list1.append(i)
    list2 = []
    for y in list1:
        if all([x % y == 0 for x in b]):
                list2.append(y)
    return len(list2)
    
  TIPs: if two lists have same range, use zip:
  for i, j in zip(range(x), range(y)):
    # Stuff...
    
  3:
      for i in range (len(topic)):
        for j in range(i+1,len(topic)):
            m=compare(topic[i],topic[j])
