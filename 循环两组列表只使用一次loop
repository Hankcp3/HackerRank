There will be two arrays of integers. Determine all integers that satisfy the following two conditions:

The elements of the first array are all factors of the integer being considered
The integer being considered is a factor of all elements of the second array
These numbers are referred to as being between the two arrays. Determine how many such numbers exist.

def getTotalX(a, b):
    list1 = []
    for i in range(a[-1],b[0]+1):
        if all([i % j == 0 for j in a]):
            list1.append(i)
    list2 = []
    for y in list1:
        if all([x % y == 0 for x in b]):
                list2.append(y)
    return len(list2)
    
  TIPs: if two lists have same range, use zip:
  for i, j in zip(range(x), range(y)):
    # Stuff...
