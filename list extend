The extend() method adds all the elements of an iterable (list, tuple, string etc.)

def closestNumbers(arr):
    arr.sort()
    output = []
    minimum = arr[1] - arr[0]
    for i in range(1, len(arr)): 
        diff = arr[i] - arr[i-1]
        if diff == minimum: 
            output.extend([arr[i-1], arr[i]])
        if diff < minimum: 
            minimum = diff 
            output = [arr[i-1], arr[i]]
    
    return output
